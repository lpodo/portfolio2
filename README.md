# Portfolio Terminal 2

## What it is

A PWA stock portfolio tracker with a Cloudflare Worker backend. Supports all major exchanges, extended hours (pre/post market), and cross-device sync via JSONBin.

## Hosting & Access

- **GitHub Pages**: `lpodo.github.io/portfolio2` — frontend
- **Cloudflare Workers**: `portfolio2.lpodolskiy.workers.dev` — price backend
- **Repository**: `lpodo/portfolio2`
- **PWA**: installable on Android/iOS as home screen app
- **Header buttons**: Refresh (updates current portfolio prices), ⋮ (view mode dropdown: P&L / WEIGHTS / MARKET)

## Stack

- Pure HTML/JS/CSS — **single file `index.html`**, no frameworks or build tools
- **Cloudflare Worker** (`worker.js`) — serverless proxy to Yahoo Finance, bypasses CORS
- PWA files: `manifest.json`, `sw.js`, `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`, `icon-32.png`, `icon-16.png`
- No npm, webpack, React — maximum portability

## Price Source

Yahoo Finance via Cloudflare Worker — free, all major exchanges, extended hours.

**Algorithm:**

1. Fast request `interval=1d` → get `regularMarketPrice`, `regularMarketTime`, `currentTradingPeriod`
2. If `now >= regular.start && now < regular.end && regularMarketTime >= regular.start` → return `regularMarketPrice`, `priceType: "regular"` (one request)
3. Otherwise → second request `interval=1m&range=5d&includePrePost=true` → find last non-null candle
4. If `lastCandle.price ≈ regularMarketPrice` → `priceType: "regular"`
5. Otherwise → `priceType: "extended"`

**Market state** (`REGULAR` / `PRE` / `POST` / `CLOSED`) is determined from `currentTradingPeriod` windows vs `now` and returned in every response.

**Worker endpoints:**
- `/api/quote?ticker=AAPL` — production quote
- `/api/debug?ticker=AAPL` — processed result (same logic)
- `/api/debug1?ticker=AAPL` — raw meta from Yahoo 1d request
- `/api/debug2?ticker=AAPL` — last candles + pre/post windows from 5d request

All endpoints require `X-API-Token: TOKEN` header. To call from curl:
```
curl -H "X-API-Token: YOUR_TOKEN" https://portfolio2.lpodolskiy.workers.dev/api/quote?ticker=AAPL
```

## Security

The worker is protected by a secret token passed in the `X-API-Token` request header. The token is stored as a Cloudflare **Secret** (not Variable) under `API_TOKEN` — secrets persist across deployments. To rotate: update `API_TOKEN` in Cloudflare → Settings → Variables and Secrets → Secret, then update in the app settings.

## Exchange Support

| Exchange | Ticker format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| NYSE / NASDAQ | no suffix | `EOG`, `AAPL` |
| LSE (London) | `.L` | `CJPU.L` |
| Xetra (Germany) | `.DE` | `CEBZ.DE` |
| Euronext Paris | `.PA` | `AIR.PA` |

## Data Storage

- **localStorage** — primary on-device storage
  - `pt_portfolios` — all portfolios and positions
  - `pt_current` — active portfolio ID
  - `pt_finnhub` — Cloudflare Worker URL (legacy key name)
  - `pt_token` — API token for Cloudflare Worker
  - `pt_sort` — sort state
  - `pt_jbkey` — JSONBin master key
  - `pt_jbbin` — JSONBin bin ID
- **JSONBin.io** — cloud sync for cross-device access

## Position Structure

```json
{
  "id": 1234567890,
  "ticker": "EOG",
  "qty": 8,
  "entry": 134.00,
  "current": 140.75,
  "priceType": "regular",
  "marketState": "REGULAR"
}
```

- `currency` — position currency code from Yahoo Finance (e.g. `GBP`, `EUR`). Saved after first price fetch. Used to show correct currency symbol in ENTRY/CURRENT columns and currency code after market state icon.
- `previousClose`, `regularMarketPrice` — saved from worker response for Market view calculations.

Note: `qty: 0` is allowed — used for watchlist candidates. Shows `—` in QTY and P&L $ columns, only P&L % is calculated.

## Portfolio Structure

```json
{
  "name": "OIL & GAS",
  "currencyCode": "USD",
  "positions": []
}
```

`currencyCode` — ISO 4217 base currency code. Serves as the **base currency** for the portfolio:
- All position values are converted to this currency for **total VALUE** and **WEIGHTS** calculations
- FX rates fetched live from Yahoo Finance (`EURUSD=X`, `GBPUSD=X`, etc.) when positions have mixed currencies
- Defaults to `USD` for legacy portfolios
- Validated against Yahoo Finance on creation/rename

## Features

- Multiple portfolios — tap name in header to switch, add, rename, delete
- Currency symbol per portfolio — set at creation, editable via rename
- Watchlist mode — add position with qty=0 to track price dynamics without holding
- Add position: ticker + qty (0 allowed) + entry price + current price (optional)
- Inline edit (✎) and delete (✕)
- Price update: ↻ per row or Refresh All (parallel, single cloud save after all done)
- Sort by any column — persists across sessions
- P&L $ for full position: `(current - entry) × qty`
- P&L % per share: `(current - entry) / entry × 100`
- **Multi-currency portfolios**: each position carries its own currency (from Yahoo Finance). ENTRY/CURRENT show position currency symbol. Totals and weights are converted to portfolio base currency via live FX rates (`EURUSD=X` etc.)
- **Summary view**: selected from the portfolio switcher (Σ SUMMARY at the bottom). Shows all non-index portfolios: NAME / VALUE (in native currency) / P&L / RETURN / SHARE%. Total row always in USD with live FX conversion. Clicking a row switches to that portfolio. Refresh on Summary updates all portfolios.
- **Index/Watchlist portfolio** (INDEX checkbox at creation): designed for tracking indices, commodities, currencies (e.g. `^KS11`, `BZ=F`, `EURUSD=X`). No qty/entry fields. Shows CLOSE (chartPreviousClose) / PRICE (regularMarketPrice) / Δ% / NAME. Sortable by TICKER and Δ%. ⋮ button disabled. Excluded from Summary.
- **Summary view** converts all portfolio values to USD using live FX rates. Total always shown in `$`
- Market state indicator after P&L %:
  - No icon — regular session (REGULAR)
  - 🌙 blue — pre or post market (PRE / POST)
  - ✦ gray — market closed (CLOSED)
- Three view modes via ⋮ dropdown menu (next to Refresh button):
  - **P&L** — default view with full position details
  - **WEIGHTS** — TICKER / VALUE / WEIGHT %; sortable by any column
  - **MARKET** — TICKER / CLOSE / CURRENT / Δ%; sortable by TICKER or Δ% (3rd click resets to portfolio order); market state icon included
    - CLOSE = `chartPreviousClose` (previous session close) — always used as Δ% base during REGULAR session
    - During CLOSED/PRE/POST: CLOSE = `regularMarketPrice` by default; if **CONTINUOUS Δ% ACROSS SESSIONS** is enabled in settings, uses `chartPreviousClose` instead
- Totals row unchanged across all views
- Summary: VALUE, P&L, RETURN

## Backup / Restore (Settings panel)

- **↓ BACKUP** — downloads `portfolio-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.json` with all portfolios to Downloads folder
- **↑ RESTORE** — loads a backup JSON file, asks for confirmation before overwriting current data

Backup format:
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "date": "2026-03-30T...",
  "portfolios": { ... }
}
```

## Data Architecture

**Cloud (JSONBin)** stores structural data — portfolios, positions, entry prices. Current prices are not actively synced to cloud — `cloudSave` is only triggered by structural changes (add/edit/delete position, portfolio changes), not by price updates.

**Prices** are always fetched live from Yahoo Finance via Cloudflare Worker. After every `cloudLoad`, `refreshAll` is triggered automatically for the current portfolio.

On portfolio switch, `refreshAll` runs automatically so prices are always fresh when you view a portfolio.

## Sync & Conflict Prevention

- `cloudSave` is called only on structural changes (add/edit/delete position, portfolio changes) — never on price updates
- After every `cloudLoad` or `cloudSave`, the cloud timestamp is stored in `pt_cloud_ts`
- Before `cloudSave`, the cloud metadata is checked — if the cloud is newer than `pt_cloud_ts`, save is blocked with an error message prompting the user to sync first
- After **RESTORE**, data is immediately pushed to cloud to mark it as the authoritative version

## Cloud Sync (Settings panel)

- **↓ SYNC FROM CLOUD** — pull latest data from JSONBin to current device
- **↑ OVERWRITE CLOUD** — push local data to JSONBin (destructive)
- Auto-save to cloud on every structural change (add/edit/delete position)
- Single cloud save after Refresh All completes
- Auto-load from cloud on app open

## Service Worker

Caches app shell for offline use. API requests are **never cached**:
- `workers.dev` — Cloudflare Worker (prices)
- `jsonbin.io` — cloud storage
- `finnhub.io` — legacy

**IMPORTANT: increment cache version string in `sw.js` on every deploy** (e.g. `portfolio-v35` → `portfolio-v36`).

## How to Start a New Dev Session

1. Paste this README
2. Paste current `index.html` from repository
3. Paste current `worker.js` from repository
4. Describe what needs to be changed

## Unused Files (legacy, safe to delete)

- `api/quote.js` — Vercel serverless function (replaced by Cloudflare Worker)
- `vercel.json` — Vercel configuration
- `server.js` — Express server for Railway
- `package.json` — npm dependencies for Railway/Vercel
